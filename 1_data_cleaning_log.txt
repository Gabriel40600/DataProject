Allie Miller                   Say hello to the Spaghetti Bot üçù ü§ñ\n\nInstead of building a highly customized hand or grasper (just look at how advanced your own hand is!) and spending endless research on object recognition and dexterity planning, this team has created a more flexible option, almost like 12 skinny octopus tentacles.\n\nThe group of hollow stretchy tentacles bump into an object (like a tennis ball) and start entangling itself around the object so it can grab it and lift it up.\n\nI guess my necklaces getting tangled up was scientific research this whole time üòâ\n\nThe paper is titled ‚ÄúActive Entanglement Enables Stochastic, Topological Grasping‚Äù and was published by a team from Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Zuse Institute Berlin in PNAS. Congratulations to the authors Becker, Teeple, Charles, Jung, Baum, Weaver, Mahadevan, and Wood.

AI is impacting countless tasks - like text generation from , personalized AI videos from , image generation from , RPA from , and AI DJing from . Lucky to have worked with a bunch of these founders. I‚Äôm excited for even more use case focus and B2B applications in the next 2 years.ASK YOURSELF: who is making this tech, what can it do, what are the limitations, how might it affect my job in 5 years, and how can I get ahead of it now.
